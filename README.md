It has been successfully held in London and San Francisco in last two years, while Beijing and Tokyo coming in 2017.

We expect to finish the translation during this Feb. Please choose one (or several) you'd like to translate and contact me (wechat: Hello_MrT) to mark. Translations will be reviewed by me and then published on DevEco's platforms, official Conference website or other social media, with the name of translator specified.
